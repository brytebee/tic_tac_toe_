## Game flow (How to Play)

- First player will be asked to select symbol to play with either X or O.
- Second player will automatically be assigned with the symbol not selected of X or O above.
- Players will be moving their symbols on board alternatively targeting to fill three same symbols successive horizontally, vertically or diagonal, to Win.
- Both players will move their symbols nine time. If none win the game, it's a draw and Game over!.
